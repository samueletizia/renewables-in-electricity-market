**Project Overview: Electricity Market Analysis with Different Considerations**

Objective: This project aims to study the operation and economics of power systems by modeling and analyzing electricity markets under different frameworks, constraints, and scenarios using the IEEE 24-node reliability test system.

Framework and Scenarios:


Develop a market-clearing optimization model without transmission network considerations for a single hour.
Calculate market-clearing price, social welfare, profits of suppliers, and utility of each demand.
Copper-plate Multiple Hours:

Extend the above model to 24 hours.
Introduce inter-temporal constraints related to hydrogen production by electrolyzers attached to wind farms.
Examine the impact of co-optimizing power and hydrogen systems.
Network Constraints:

Incorporate power flow and network constraints into the model.
Study two pricing models: nodal and zonal. Examine their implications and differences.
Balancing Market:

Model the real-time balancing market considering forecast errors in wind power production.
Investigate the role of electrolyzers in offsetting wind power deviations.
Examine how conventional generators can serve balancing needs, especially during unplanned outages.
Reserve Market:

Develop models to clear reserve and day-ahead markets sequentially (European style).
Develop a joint reserve and energy market model (US-style) and compare outcomes with the European style.
Data and Assumptions:

The test system consists of conventional generating units, wind farms, demands, and transmission lines.
Production cost of wind farms is assumed to be zero.
Electrolyzers attached to wind farms produce hydrogen, with certain operational constraints and production efficiencies.
Various market-clearing optimization techniques and constraints are applied based on the specific scenario or framework being studied.
Expected Outcomes:
The project will derive market prices, social welfare, profits, utilities, and other relevant metrics under different scenarios. It will also provide insights into the implications of different market structures, pricing mechanisms, and the role of renewable energy and hydrogen production in electricity markets.
